A simple c program to calculate the number of steps
needed to reach 1 using the Collatz Conjecture. See
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture for more information.

compile: gcc -std=c99 -o "collatz.o" "collatz.c"

You can test multiple numbers at once with a simple loop.

e.g. in bash the following will compute until ctrl-c is pressed
(assuming you compiled using the above example):


i=1;
while true; do
  collatz.o $i;
  let 'i = i + 1';
done


Fun fact, the largest number of steps needed to find 1 in the numbers
between 1 and 10,000 is 351; the number is 77031.
